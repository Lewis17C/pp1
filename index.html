    <p>The SS Edmund Fitzgerald was constructed in 1957, commisioned by Northwestern mutual life insurance as a business venture, the ship is named after 
        the insurance companies President. She was launched in June of 1958 in River Rouge, Michigan. The ship was bult to transport taconite pellets across the Great Lakes.
         The SS Edmund Fitzgerald was the largest ship on the Great Lakes for 13 years, and was built to just narrowly fit through the locks,
          famously spectators could reach out and touch the ship as she passed through the locks, so close to the walls it was. She was 729 feet long and weighed 13, 632 tons, making her Queen of the Lakes 
          (an unofficial title given to the longest ship sailing on the Great Lakes). The ships launch was marred by tragedy and bad omens.
           It took 3 attempts to break the bottle on the ships hull to christen the ship, which was considdered by many to be a bads omen.
            Furthermore, upon her launching, a massive wave from her wake collapsed a nearby grandstand, which caused a spectator to suffer a fatal heart attack.
             The SS Edmund Fitzgerald would operate on the Great Lakes for 17 years before her tragic end, when most ships retire after 40 to 50 years.</p>

        <p>On November 9, 1975, the Edmund Fitzgerald departed a dock in Burlington, Wisconsin for what would ultimately be her last journey across Lake Superior. Another ship, the SS Arthur M. Anderson. The 2 ships maintained radio contact while the Edmund Fitzgerald steamed ahead. Both captains were aware of a storm making its way towards Superior from the Great Plains so they sailed along the northerly course so they could use the highlands for protection. Gale warnings were issued at 7pm, November 9, but by the afternoon of November 10, this was upgraded to a storm warning, although the conditions were treacherous, both captains had been through worse and so they pushed on.</p>
        <p>At 3:30pm on November 10, the Edmund Fitzgerald radioed the Anderson to requesting the Anderson to accompany them to Whitefish Bay, as the Fitzgerald had lost a fence rail, lost or damaged 2 vents and had a list. Captain McSorley also told the Anderson that they were running their water pumps, implying the Fitzgerald was taking on water. The Anderson was struck by 2 massive waves at 6:55pm, one after the other, described by Captain Cooper of the Anderson as so “Then the Anderson just raised up and shook herself off of all that water – barrooff – just like a big dog. Another wave just like the first one or bigger hit us again. I watched those two waves head down the lake towards the Fitzgerald, and I think those were the two that sent her under.”</p>
        <p>The weather had deteriorated so much by the evening of November 10 that it was interfering with the Andersons radar, but their last communication with the Fitzgerald occured at 7:10pm, when asked by the Andersons radio operator how they were managing with the problems, Captain McSorley replied "We are holding our own" this would be the last communication to leave the Fitzgerald, and 5 minutes later, the Fitzgerald would disappear from the Andersons radar and she would not reappear. The crew of the Anderson quickly realised the Fitzgerald had likely been bested by the Lake, with no other ships in the area having sighted her. The Anderson communicated with the coast guard, and despite now being in the safety of Whitefish Bay, the coast guard requested the Anderson to return to the last known site of the Fitzgerald, to which the Anderson bravely obliged. The Anderson discovered 2 of the Fitzgeralds lifeboats and some debris, but no surviors and no sign of the ship itself.</p>

        <h2 id="search-heading">The Search</h2>
        <p>The Anderson would be the primary vessel in the search for the Fitzgerald, with only 1 other ship, the William Clay Ford, able to assist that night due to the conditions. The coast guard launched an aircraft and 2 cutters at 10pm, with the first cutter arriving at 12:45pm on November 11, but the other cutter didn't arrive until November 14, as it had travelled from Minnesota. On November 14, the coast guard was able to determine the Fitzgeralds general location using magnetic technology and over the next 3 days the USCGC Woodrush located 2 large pieces of a ship, with further surveys of the area taking place throughout the month, this was surely the Fitzgerald, but a proper search and recovery attempt would be delayed until May of 1976. The US navy sent an underwater recovery vehicle to aid in the search effort, this vehicle took a large amount of video and picture evidence of the wreck, and revealed the name of the wreck, it was the Edmund Fitzgerald. 535 feet below the surface of Lake Superior, the Edmund Fitzgerald lay, broken and scattered across the floor of the Lake. The reason for the Fitzgeralds sinking was hotly debated, with blame being laid at the feet of Captain Sorley, for possibly scraping the bottom of the ship over the 6 Fathom Shoal, to the crew for allegedly not closing the hatches correctly. As the years went on, more concrete theories emerged, and although nothing is certain, the leading theory supposes the Fitzgerald was damaged passing over 6 Fathom Shoal, causing her to take on water and lose buoyancy, she then likely submarined bow first, with the weight of the taconite pellets shifting forward rapidly, the ship then snapped in half and sunk rapidly, all this would've happedned in seconds. We may never know what definitively caused the Fitzgerald to give out, after numerous dives in the years after the wreckage, the wreck site was essentially marked as a grave site, and all diving is strictly prohibitted in the surrounding area.  </p>
